- Create a randomly generated data equivalent of the ohlcvt for two or more instruments
    - ohlctv -> Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, Timestamp
- Use that generated data to complete the code of finding cointergreted pairs, backward testing, forward testing and live testing
- Once all the coding part is done, get subscription from kite.trade to get real data
- Complete finding cointegered pairs, backward testing, forward testing and live testing within the subscription period (i.e., 30 days)
