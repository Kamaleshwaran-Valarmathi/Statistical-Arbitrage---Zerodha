Todo
====
- Use that generated data to complete the code of finding cointergreted pairs, backward testing, forward testing and live testing
- Once all the coding part is done, get subscription from kite.trade to get real data
- Complete finding cointegered pairs, backward testing, forward testing and live testing within the subscription period (i.e., 30 days)

Done
====
- Create a randomly generated data equivalent of the ohlcvt for two or more instruments
    - ohlctv -> Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, Timestamp
- Creating visalization for the data

In Progress
===========
- Want to convert the codebase for finding Cointegrated Pairs from Python to C++
    - After running the codebase for the test data, it is found that the python will take around 1 year to process through all the combinations in the actual data
- Codebase for finding Cointegrated Pairs
    - Variables to be included while finding the cointegrated pairs
        - (spread - fees)
    - Fees & Leverage of an instrument can be found using the `Margin calculation` API
